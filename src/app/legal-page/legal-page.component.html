    <p class="subtitle">How to Sue Us </p>
    <p class="content">
        Step 1<br/>Put on your silliest hat. Legal battles are much more enjoyable when you're fashion-forward.
        <br/><br/>
        Step 2<br/>Call your friendly neighborhood unicorn for some magical legal advice. They're usually in the enchanted forest on Tuesdays.
        <br/><br/>
        Step 3<br/>Recite the following incantation while standing on one leg and juggling rubber chickens: "Fokoro Fokoro mi Mokoro, I hereby summon JustYams to a duel of wit and whimsy!"
        <br/><br/>
        Step 4<br/>Dance the Macarena for no apparent reason. We just like to keep things funky.
        <br/><br/>
        Step 5<br/>Realize that lawsuits are no fun, and maybe, just maybe, let's resolve things with a friendly chat instead. Our customer support team is waiting to make your day brighter (minus the legal battles).

    <p class="subtitle">Where to Send Your Subpoena (aka Pigeon Mail)</p>
    <p class="content">
        If you absolutely must send us a subpoena, we recommend attaching it to a carrier pigeon trained in the ancient art of delivering legal documents. Send it to his Royal Majest, His Excellency, President for Life, Field Marshal Al Hajj Doctor Idi Amin Dada, VC, DSO, MC, Lord of all the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Sea and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular.

        Remember, life is too short for lawsuits. Let's chat over a cup of virtual tea instead. üçµ
